## Project_title: Inventory Optimization Via Demand Forecasting: Analyzing Sales Data and Market Trends
This project focused on mastering Python to develop and apply machine learning techniques for robust demand forecast modeling. 
The objective was to equip myself with the skills necessary to make accurate predictions and optimize inventory management strategies. 
Through this hands-on experience, I learned to model complex datasets, allowing for better decision-making in inventory control based on predicted market demands.

## Business Overview/Problem
SupplySaver Corporation faces a pressing business challenge - the need for precise inventory optimization through demand forecasting. This challenge stems from several specific obstacles:

- A. Fluctuating Demand Patterns: The company grapples with unpredictable demand patterns across various product categories, leading to excessive inventory levels or stockouts.
- B. High Carrying Costs: Maintaining excess inventory incurs substantial carrying costs, impacting profitability.
  Customer Satisfaction: Inaccurate inventory management affects the company's ability to meet customer demands promptly, potentially leading to customer dissatisfaction.
- C. Supply Chain Efficiency: Inventory inaccuracies hinder the overall efficiency of the supply chain, affecting the timely delivery of goods.
- D. Competitive Edge: The logistics industry is highly competitive, and the company recognizes that optimizing inventory is essential for maintaining a competitive edge.

## Rationale for the Project
Demand forecasting is a crucial aspect of business operations that involves estimating future customer demand for a product or service. It plays a pivotal role in various aspects of a business, including inventory management, production planning, and overall strategic decision-making.
Inventory Optimization through Demand Forecasting in the Logistics and Supply Chain industry is paramount for several reasons:
- A. Optimizing Inventory Levels: Accurate demand forecasts help businesses maintain optimal inventory levels. Overstocking leads to excess holding costs, while understocking can result in lost sales and dissatisfied customers. By forecasting demand accurately, businesses can strike the right balance.
- B. Sales and Marketing Strategies: Demand forecasts provide valuable insights for sales and marketing teams. They can use this information to set sales targets, design promotional campaigns, and allocate resources towards areas where demand is expected to be high.
- C. Seasonal and Cyclical Trends: Many industries experience seasonal or cyclical variations in demand. By analyzing historical data and employing sophisticated forecasting techniques, businesses can anticipate these fluctuations and make informed decisions on inventory levels, production schedules, and staffing.
- D. Customer Service and Satisfaction: Meeting customer demand in a timely manner is crucial for customer satisfaction. Accurate demand forecasting ensures that businesses can fulfill orders promptly, leading to higher customer satisfaction levels and increased customer loyalty.

## Aim of the Project
The primary goal of this project is to enhance demand forecasting in the Logistics and Supply Chain industry, driven by several key objectives. 
- A. It aims to minimize carrying costs associated with excess inventory through the implementation of precise demand forecasting models. 
- B. Furthermore, the project seeks to elevate customer service levels by ensuring accurate inventory management, ultimately resulting in enhanced customer satisfaction. 
- C. Additionally, the project strives to optimize supply chain efficiency by streamlining operations, reducing lead times, and improving overall performance. 
- D. Lastly, the project endeavors to boost profitability by curbing carrying costs and augmenting sales through refined demand forecasting practices.

## Data Description
The inventory dataset comprises the following features:
✓ Date: The date of the data point, representing historical sales records.
✓ Product_ID: A unique identifier for each product in the inventory.
✓ Demand: The demand value for a specific product on a given date, representing the quantity of the product requested.
These features provide essential information for analyzing and optimizing inventory levels, understanding demand patterns, and making data-driven decisions in the logistics and supply chain industry.

## Tech Stack
- Programming language – Python
- Libraries to be used
- A. Numpy: For performing mathematical operations over data
- B. Pandas: For Data Analysis and Manipulation
- C. Matplotlib.pyplot: For Data Visualization
- D. Seaborn: For Data Visualization
- E. Scikit-learn: For Machine Learning

## Project Scope
- A. Data Preprocessing: This crucial step involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the raw data for analysis. It includes tasks such as handling missing values, removing outliers,
  and standardizing data formats. In the context of demand forecasting, data preprocessing ensures that the input data is reliable and consistent, laying the foundation for accurate predictions.
- B. Feature Engineering: Feature engineering is the process of creating or selecting relevant features (input variables) from the available data that will be used for modeling. It may involve
  feature extraction, transformation, scaling, or the creation of new features to improve the predictive power of the models.
- C. Forecast Model Development; Various modeling techniques are applied to the prepared data in this stage to build predictive or descriptive models. This can include machine learning algorithms,
  statistical models, or other analytical approaches. The models are trained, validated, and fine-tuned to optimize their performance.
- D. Model Evaluation and Selection: Once the models are developed, they are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and validation techniques. This involves assessinag their performance,
  generalizability, and robustness. The best-performing model(s) are selected for further deployment or refinement.

 ## Model Interpretation, Selection, and Recommendations for Inventory Optimization

As part of our project to enhance inventory management through demand forecasting, we've focused on using weekly data to reduce forecasting errors. We evaluated four models: XGBOOST, ARIMA, SARIMA, and Exponential Smoothing. Our primary metric for evaluation was the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), valued for its interpretability.

## Model Performance
### XGBOOST
MAE: 40.46
RMSE: 47.79
MAPE: 23.04%

### ARIMA
MAE: 41.67
RMSE: 48.85
MAPE: 20.66%

### SARIMA
MAE: 29.34
RMSE: 37.22
MAPE: 16.33%

### Exponential Smoothing
MAE: 28.35
RMSE: 36.31
MAPE: 15.88%

##cModel Selection
The Exponential Smoothing model stood out with the lowest MAE, RMSE, and MAPE values, indicating the highest accuracy in capturing demand patterns.

## Recommendations
1. Model Adoption: Implement the Exponential Smoothing model for inventory forecasting.
2. Model Fine-Tuning: Further adjust the model's parameters to enhance accuracy.
3. Continuous Monitoring: Regularly update and retrain the model with fresh data to maintain accuracy.
4. Data-Driven Decisions: Use the forecasts to optimize stock levels, reduce stockouts, and make informed inventory decisions.
   
This analysis highlights the importance of selecting the right forecasting model tailored to specific data and business needs. 
Transitioning from monthly to weekly forecasting notably improved model performance, underscoring the value of granular data analysis.
